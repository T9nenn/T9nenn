I'm T9nenn.

I'm a beginner in python, I know some very basic stuff required for data analysis with python plus some descriptive statistics.
Other than that I like math, drawing stuff and niche music genres with 3~4 artist in RYM.
I would put sopme copyasta but whatever the readme uses (probably markdown) breaks them U_U.
